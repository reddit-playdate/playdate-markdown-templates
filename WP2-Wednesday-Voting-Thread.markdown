# Weekly Playdate Voting Post

## Voting

We had a [nominations thread on Monday](https://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/75dnoi/weekly_playdate_nominations_post/). Now it's time to vote.

Use [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1lj9o23YQHXRSI80xdXLAIVUuqFBYyiE_1HtTq6bEzmg) to cast a vote for your favorite game to play next week. Use this thread or other places (like [discord](https://discord.gg/playdate)) to discuss this week's selection and persuade people to vote your way.

On Friday, one final thread will go up naming the playdate for the coming week.

## What Are Playdates

A playdate is a week-long event where Redditors play the same game together. The idea is to be able to find someone to play it whenever you are free versus having one specific time for people to flake out on. Use playdates to revive your favorite (but dead) multiplayer game, hunt unearned multiplayer achievements, and simply connect with other gamers.

We play games outside the weekly focus times too, of course ;-) We're just bringing /r/Playdate back to its [roots](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/j8hpz/idea_for_subreddit_organize_nights_around/).
