## What Are Playdates

A playdate is a week-long event where Redditors play the same game together. The idea is to be able to find someone to play it whenever you are free versus having one specific time for people to flake out on. Use playdates to revive your favorite (but dead) multiplayer game, hunt unearned multiplayer achievements, and simply connect with other gamers.

We play games outside the weekly focus times too, of course ;-) We're just bringing /r/Playdate back to its [roots](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/j8hpz/idea_for_subreddit_organize_nights_around/).
