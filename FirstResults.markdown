# Weekly Playdate Results Post

## What Are Playdates

A playdate is a week-long event where Redditors play the same game together. The idea is to be able to find someone to play it whenever you are free versus having one specific time for people to flake out on. Use playdates to revive your favorite (but dead) multiplayer game, hunt unearned multiplayer achievements, or whatever other reason you can come up with.

Feel free to play other games too, of course ;-) We're just bringing /r/Playdate back to its [roots](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/j8hpz/idea_for_subreddit_organize_nights_around/).

# Results

We had a [nominations thread](https://redd.it/75dnoi) on Monday, [voting thread](https://redd.it/75txk1) on Wednesday, and now it time for the results.

This week's playdate is:

    INSERT_GAME
    Price: INSERT_PRICE
    Description: INSERT_DESCRIPTION

Let's make this first Playdate a great one.
