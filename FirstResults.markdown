# Weekly Playdate Results Post

## What Are Playdates

A playdate is a week-long event where Redditors play the same game together. The idea is to be able to find someone to play it whenever you are free versus having one specific time for people to flake out on. Use playdates to revive your favorite (but dead) multiplayer game, hunt unearned multiplayer achievements, or whatever other reason you can come up with.

Feel free to play other games too, of course ;-) We're just bringing /r/Playdate back to its [roots](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/j8hpz/idea_for_subreddit_organize_nights_around/).

Let's make this first Playdate a great one. Join our [discord](https://discord.gg/playdate), [steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/joinplaydate) or make a new post and find someone to play this game with. You can also use this thread for organizing.

Discord is currently our most active place to find people, but don't let it stop you from using others if you prefer them.
