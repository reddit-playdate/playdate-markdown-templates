# Weekly Playdate Voting Post

## What Are Playdates

A playdate is a week-long event where Redditors play the same game together. The idea is to be able to find someone to play it whenever you are free versus having one specific time for people to flake out on. Use playdates to revive your favorite (but dead) multiplayer game, hunt unearned multiplayer achievements, or whatever other reason you can come up with.

Feel free to play other games too, of course ;-) We're just bringing /r/Playdate back to its [roots](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/j8hpz/idea_for_subreddit_organize_nights_around/).

## Voting

We had a [nominations thread on monday](https://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/75dnoi/weekly_playdate_nominations_post/). Now it's time to vote.

You can use [this](INSERT_FORM_LINK) to vote on your favorite game to play for the next week. Feel free to use this thread or other places (like [discord](https://discord.gg/playdate)) to talk about the games and persuade people to vote your way.

## Results

On Friday, one final thread will go up declaring a winner of the voting round. This game will be the week's playdate.

The main platform for live organization is our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/playdate), but we welcome you to comment in the results thread, make a post here in the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/submit?selftext=true), and keep in touch through our [Steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/joinplaydate).
