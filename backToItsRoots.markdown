# Let's bring /r/Playdate back to its roots.

## What even are /r/Playdate's roots

This subreddit is the result of a post made six years ago on /r/gaming, [Idea for Subreddit: Organize Nights Around Swarming Unpopular Multiplayer Games](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/j8hpz/idea_for_subreddit_organize_nights_around/). The idea was a simple one; organize groups of Redditors to mob a different unpopular multiplayer games for an evening or two each week.

If you've browsed /r/Playdate for a while you've probably seen one of these nominations threads, and remember seeing games linked in the sidebar weekly. But as participation in Playdate focus-times has decreased, this subreddit has increasingly become a LFG hub rather than a means to direct Redditors towards unloved games in need of some attention.

## What are we going to do

We're going to post weekly announcements taking a vote for a game to focus on the following week. One result of last year's [Playdate Community Survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/4s8mq4/results_2016_playdate_community_survey/) was that scheduling kept people from participating in playdates, so rather than designate one day and time let's agree to focus on a game for a seven day period and get sessions going every time we reach a critical mass of available people.

As an incentive I will raffle off Steam keys to participating playmates. I have a lengthy list of Humble Bundle leftovers as well as keys donated by the Playdate community. I'm not going to guarantee you'll get a game that you want, but it's better than being forever alone.

## What can you do

You're already doing it, and thank you for that. Thanks for reading, commenting, and voting on threads here. Keep it up! When the first announcement goes up make sure to vote or nominate games you'd like to see in future polls.
