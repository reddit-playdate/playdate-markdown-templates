# This week's playdate is:

[Board Game Online](https://www.boardgame-online.com/)

Price: Free!

Description: BG Online is a board game. Online. Without a board, really. But on a website. Seriously though, it is! Just like all your classic board games you play this game with a bunch of other people and the first to cross the finish line wins! With the addition of hookers and brutal murders, of course.

## Remember, this is a week long playdate

- If you can't play this exact second, that's ok.
- Keep an eye on the Discord server, Steam group, and subreddit; there will be multiple opportunities to play together.

# What happened this week?

- We're back! We kind of skipped a week.
- Playmates Waka and Jam have an ARK server setup. Hit them up on Discord for details.
- People have been on a bit of an Overwatch kick lately.
- sneakybehave is starting a new game of Wasteland 2 and would love to chat with you about it.
- One of our nominations this week was [The Ship: Murder Party](http://store.steampowered.com/app/2400/The_Ship_Murder_Party/). /u/einexile had a good question: is this the same *The Ship* we know and love? It is! If you already owned *The Ship Remastered* you'll also have *Murder Party* in your library. It's the same game plus a few single-player features.

## What Are Playdates

A playdate is a week-long event where Redditors play the same game together. The idea is to be able to find someone to play it whenever you are free versus having one specific time for people to flake out on. Use playdates to revive your favorite (but dead) multiplayer game, hunt unearned multiplayer achievements, and simply connect with other gamers.

We play games outside the weekly focus times too, of course ;-) We're just bringing /r/Playdate back to its [roots](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/j8hpz/idea_for_subreddit_organize_nights_around/).
