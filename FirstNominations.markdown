# First Weekly Playdate Nominations Post

## What Are Playdates

A playdate is a week-long event where Redditors play the same game together. The idea is to be able to find someone to play it whenever you are free versus having one specific time for people to flake out on. It can be to revive your favorite (but dead) multiplayer game, hunt unearned multiplayer achievements, or whatever other reason you can come up with.

Feel free to play other games too, of course ;-) We're just bringing /r/Playdate back to its [roots](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/j8hpz/idea_for_subreddit_organize_nights_around/).

## Nominations

Use this thread to nominate a game to include in the next vote. Just the game name is fine, but try to include other details as well (price/brief description).

Example:

    Transformice
    Price: Free
    Platform: Windows/Mac/Linux/Broswer
    Description: A fun old flash game where you try to grab cheese as quickly as you can with the help of a shaman.
                 It times how fast you get the cheese which adds a speed component to it as well.

## Voting

On Wednesday, another post will be going up with a form to vote on. You can also use that post for some extra discussion on the nominated games.

## Results

On Friday, one final thread will go up with the winner of the voting round. This game will be the Playdate game we play for the next week (until the following Friday). The main platform for live organization is our [discord server](https://discord.gg/playdate), but feel free to comment in the results thread, make a post in the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/submit?selftext=true), or join our [steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/joinplaydate) as well.
