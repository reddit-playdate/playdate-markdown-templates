## What Are Playdates

A playdate is a week-long event where Redditors play the same game together. The idea is to be able to find someone to play it whenever you are free versus having one specific time for people to flake out on. Revive your favorite (but dead) multiplayer game. Hunt unearned multiplayer achievements.

Feel free to play other games too, of course ;-) We're just staying bringing /r/Playdate back to our [roots](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/j8hpz/idea_for_subreddit_organize_nights_around/).

## Voting

Use [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/GRRMQxSOZiXjb22z1) to rate selected games for the upcoming playdate. We will announce a winner and start holding sessions next week, as well as open up a new round of voting.

## Nominations

Use this thread to nominate a game to include in the next vote. Just the game name it fine, but try to include other details as well (price/brief description).

example:

    Transformice
    Price: Free
    Platform: Windows/Mac/Linux/Broswer
    Description: A fun old flash game where you try to grab cheese as quickly as you can with the help of a shaman.
                 It times how fast you get the cheese which adds a speed component to it as well.
