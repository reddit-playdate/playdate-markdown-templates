## What are Playdates?

Playdate's will be week long events where we play the same game together. The idea is to be able to find someone to play it whenever you are free vs having one specific time people can't make.

Feel free to try and play other games too of course.

## Voting

Check out [this form](https://discordapp.com/invite/Pqyp543/) and vote for your favourite game or games. We'll choose the winner at <INSERT_DATE_HERE> an make an announcement for it.

## Nominations

You can use this thread to nominate a weekly game for the next vote. Just the game name it fine, but try to include other things as well (price/brief description).

ex:

    Transformice
    Price: Free
    Platform: Windows/Mac/Linux/Broswer
    Description: A fun old flash game where you try to grab cheese as quickly as you can with the help of a shaman.
                 It times how fast you get the cheese which adds a speed component to it as well.

This is the first Playdate we've done in a while, so let's make it (and all the future ones) great.
