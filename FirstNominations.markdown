# Weekly Playdate Nominations Post

## What Are Playdates

A playdate is a week-long event where Redditors play the same game together. The idea is to be able to find someone to play it whenever you are free versus having one specific time for people to flake out on. Use playdates to revive your favorite (but dead) multiplayer game, hunt unearned multiplayer achievements, or whatever other reason you can come up with.

Feel free to play other games too, of course ;-) We're just bringing /r/Playdate back to its [roots](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/j8hpz/idea_for_subreddit_organize_nights_around/).

## Nominations

Use this thread to nominate a game you would like to see included in the next vote. Just the game name is fine, but try to include other details as well (price/brief description).

Example:

    Transformice
    Price: Free
    Platform: Windows/Mac/Linux/Broswer
    Description: A fun old flash game where you try to grab cheese as fast as you can with a shaman's help.
                 It times how fast you get the cheese which adds a speed component to it as well.

On Wednesday, a post will go up that includes a form to vote with. Use that post as a place for extra discussion on the nominated games. Friday, one final thread will go up declaring a winner. This game will be the week's playdate.
